Every 5 seconds a computer gets infected with a virus. 13% of Americans actually believe that some parts of the moon are made of cheese. The world's youngest parents were 8 and 9 and lived in China in 1910. If you could count the number of times a cricket chirps in one minute, divide by 2, add 9 and divide by 2 again, you would have the correct temperature in Celsius degrees... How do they know that.

China was the first country to introduce paper money (in 812), but it wasn't until 1661 that a bank (Banco-Sedlar of Sweden) issued banknotes.

Until the 19th century, solid blocks of tea were used as money in Siberia.
